# leaked-discord-tokens
## Why am I seeing this?
Your Discord bot and/or user token has been leaked. Often this is an accident, so please be more careful. The reason I am posting these tokens onto GitHub is Discord automatically resets tokens that were posted on GitHub. I am trying to <u>help</u> you by resetting your token before bad actors get their hands on it.
